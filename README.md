# One Touch Inventory Management

We will create an inventory management system for companies mostly focused on assets assigned to employees.

### New Technology
*	Utilize OAuth and Passport for our login system
* Utilize a CSV import library for inventory imports
### Front End
There will be three portals for each different type of user. Each one will provide a clean view showing the data associated with their user type. Admin users will see reports and be able to edit database items. Warehouse users will be able to add new inventory and update inventory. Users will be able to see assigned assets.
